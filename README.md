## Supported Sites:
- Danbooru
- Gelbooru
- Konachan
- Probably many others that use Danbooru or Gelbooru code.

## How To Use:
- Download latest release file, or "release" folder from the repository (delete update.zip if you do!).
- Extract the .zip file.
- Copy the "xBooru" folder to Q:/plugins/pictures
- Run the add-on and enjoy!

## Issues:
- Gelbooru-type source currently don't work due to a malformed URL issue.
- Danbooru only works with headers off (but introduces the issue of pagination causing a 403). Other Danbooru-type sources don't have this issue.
- You tell me.

# TODO: 
- Implement more than just "Recent Posts" and "Search".
